# Josh Schertz Personal Website

This is my website v2. My first site was in Wordpress, and it was slow and bloated. This new site is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a static web framework. This means that it is super fast!!

My website lists my main projects and my amazing blog posts.

Check it out [here](https://joshschertz.com)

Enjoy!
