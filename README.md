# Josh Schertz Personal Website

This is storing the files for my personal website, [joshschertz.com](joshschertz.com).

Currently, the website is using WordPress, thus I don't have HTML files for most pages. However, I am starting to duplicate the pages in HTML.

All future blog posts I write will be created in HTML and stored here.

Eventually I want to move my website to a static framework, either Hugo or Jekyll.
