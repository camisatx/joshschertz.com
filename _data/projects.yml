- name:  Sayv Bot
  descr: Event driven trading system using machine learning. Built in <font color="red">Python</font> using <font color="red">Pandas</font>, <font color="red">Numpy</font>, and <font color="red">Scikit-Learn</font>. Used supervised <font color="red">Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)</font> classifier to generate a model that placed each tradable stock into one of two buckets based on their prior trading performance. This sorted data was then used to calculate the projected profit probability of a hypothetical trade using current market prices. The hypothetical trades with the best profit probabilities were then executed with our broker. The main strategy we used generated a stable weekly return of 0.5%.
