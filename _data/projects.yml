- name:  12 Startups in 12 Months
  url:   https://joshschertz.com/2018/12/06/12-Startups-in-12-Months
  descr: A personal challenge to build and market 12 startups in 12 months. Started in late November 2018, the goal is to iterate through many ideas and try to get traction with the MVP I build for each startup. Current startups include <a href="https://thecontact.guru" target="_blank">The Contact Guru</a>, <a href="https://thespaceresource.com" target="_blank">The Space Resource</a>, and <a href="https://thevibe.city" target="_blank">The Vibe</a>.

- name:  Web Development
  url:   webdev
  descr: Rapip design and development of custom websites. For advanced projects I use <font color="red">React</font> for the frontend and <font color="red">Flask</font> for the backend API. I use <font color="red">SquareSpace</font> for simple sites. Check out my portfolio <a href="https://joshschertz.com/projects/webdev">here</a>.

- name:  grokSpace
  url:   https://grokspace.io
  descr: grokSpace is streamlining and enabling novel space analysis by building a comprehensive dataset with accompanying tools and high accuracy orbital models. In traditional space research, fragmented data from separate sources is analyzed in silos, resulting in duplicated work and wasted resources. Only when the many rich yet disparate sources of space data are brought together in one location can that information reveal its full insights, while enabling users to focus on their core goal. We empower users to learn and explore space data, where they can perform their own analysis and interact directly with published results.

- name:  pySecMaster
  url:   https://github.com/camisatx/pySecMaster
  descr: A open sourced <font color="red">Python</font> and <font color="red">Postgres</font> based system to store and maintain financial data. Uses a custom ID structure for linking all stock and option prices to their respective corporate data (financials, earnings, dividends, etc.). Scrapers are used to retrieve daily and minute stock prices and exchange information. Custom scrapers can retrieve corporate activities (earnings, dividends, IPOs, conference calls), economic events, financial statements, and option chains and prices.

- name:  Sayv Bot
  descr: Event driven trading system with automated strategies that use machine learning to trade stocks and options. Built in <font color="red">Python</font> using <font color="red">Pandas</font>, <font color="red">Numpy</font>, and <font color="red">Scikit-Learn</font>. The main strategy used a supervised <font color="red">Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)</font> classifier to generate a model that placed each tradable stock into one of two buckets based on their prior trading performance. This sorted data was then used to calculate the projected profit probability of a hypothetical trade using current market prices. The hypothetical trades with the best profit probabilities were then executed with our broker. This strategy generated a stable weekly return of 0.5% over the 6 months it was run.

- name:  Robotics
  url:   robotics
  descr: I am building a 5 degree of freedom robot arm that will use cutting edge techniques for the controlling software, gripper design, and perception pipeline. The arm uses <font color="red">ROS</font> for control via a <font color="red">Ubuntu</font> to <font color="red">Arduino</font> serial connection. View my current progress <a href="https://joshschertz.com/projects/robotics">here</a>. I am documenting the process of building the arm, designing the <font color="red">CAD</font> model, experimenting with <font color="red">pneumatic grippers</font>, writing the <font color="red">cyclic coordinate descent</font> (CCD) inverse kinematic control software, and integrating <font color="red">Dex-Net 2.0</font> into the perception pipeline.

- name:  Panoply Images
  url:   https://panoplyimages.com
  descr: Image processing web app that allows you to prepare your photos for the web. Not only can images be compressed and resized, but their EXIF data can be cleaned up or removed. For privacy, it is especially important to remove the GPS EXIF data from images. This web site is build in <font color="red">Flask</font>, and is hosted on an <font color="red">AWS EC2 instance</font>.

- name:  Help Me Vote
  descr: Revolutionizing how people prepare for elections. Help Me Vote was a website that visualized how politicians act in office, showing relationships that might have influence their decisions. <i>Transparency is required for health democracies.</i> The site was built on <font color="red">Django</font> using <font color="red">Postgres</font> and <font color="red">Nginx</font>, and was run in <font color="red">Docker</font> containers on an <font color="red">Ubuntu</font> server.

- name:  System Administration
  descr: Build and maintain physical systems running <font color="red">Linux</font> and <font color="red">Windows</font>. Systems include storage servers, desktop computers, compute servers, and remote servers. Configured and monitor RAID arrays, multi-OS file sharing setup, network infrastructure and system backups. Check out my Ubuntu server setup script <a href="https://github.com/camisatx/Guides/blob/master/scripts/new_server_setup" target="_blank">here</a>.

- name:  Embedded Electronics
  descr: Assembled and programmed multiple custom electonics projects utilizing Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's. Systems include smart home automation and security system.

- name:  Computer Troubleshooting
  descr: Fix and consult technical issues for hire and pro bono. Issues range from malware, hardware failures, network issues, bloatware cleanup, security lessons, and establishing backup plans.
