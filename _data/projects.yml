  descr: I am building a 5 degree of freedom robot arm that will use cutting edge techniques for the controlling software, gripper design, and perception pipeline. The arm uses <font color="red">ROS</font> for control via a <font color="red">Ubuntu</font> to <font color="red">Arduino</font> serial connection. View my current progress <a href="https://joshschertz.com/projects/robotics">here</a>. I am documenting the process of building the arm, designing the <font color="red">CAD</font> model, experimenting with <font color="red">pneumatic grippers</font>, writing the <font color="red">cyclic coordinate descent</font> (CCD) inverse kinematic control software, and integrating <font color="red">Dex-Net 2.0</font> into the perception pipeline.

  descr: A open sourced <font color="red">Python</font> and <font color="red">Postgres</font> based system to store and maintain financial data. Uses a custom ID structure for linking all stock and option prices to their respective corporate data (financials, earnings, dividends, etc.). Scrapers are used to retrieve daily and minute stock prices and exchange information. Custom scrapers can retrieve corporate activities (earnings, dividends, IPOs, conference calls), economic events, financial statements, and option chains and prices.

- name:  Sayv Bot
  descr: Event driven trading system with automated strategies that use machine learning to trade stocks and options. Built in <font color="red">Python</font> using <font color="red">Pandas</font>, <font color="red">Numpy</font>, and <font color="red">Scikit-Learn</font>. The main strategy used a supervised <font color="red">Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)</font> classifier to generate a model that placed each tradable stock into one of two buckets based on their prior trading performance. This sorted data was then used to calculate the projected profit probability of a hypothetical trade using current market prices. The hypothetical trades with the best profit probabilities were then executed with our broker. This strategy generated a stable weekly return of 0.5% over the 6 months it was run.

  descr: Image processing web app that allows you to prepare your photos for the web. Not only can images be compressed and resized, but their EXIF data can be cleaned up or removed. For privacy, it is especially important to remove the GPS EXIF data from images. This web site is build in <font color="red">Flask</font>, and is hosted on an <font color="red">AWS EC2 instance</font>.
