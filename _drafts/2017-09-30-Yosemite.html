<p>There have been multiple deadly rock slides at Yosemite since I was there two weeks ago. My thoughts go out to those affected. Yosemite is the most beautiful place I have ever been, but that beauty is due to the raw ruggedness of the environment. There are few places in the world where you will discover a sheer 2,000 foot drop at the end of a peaceful forest hike.</p>

<p>I only had a single day to explore Yosemite, but I made sure to view all the highlights the valley had to offer.</p>
