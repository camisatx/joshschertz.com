<p>Billions of dollars worth of goods travel across the North Atlantic every year. However, climate change is causing increasing numbers of icebergs to drift into major shipping lanes, forcing vessels to drastically slow or take lengthy detours.</p>

<p>Current services for iceberg monitoring provide predictions on where icebergs are likely to be. These services utilize satellite images, human tracking (normally via the coast guard), and computer modeling. Even with all these components, ships still do not know the exact location of icebergs.</p>

<p><i>Iceberg Tracker</i> will allow mariners to know the exact location of all sizable icebergs by having a wave powered robotic vessel follow each iceberg, transmitting its location via AIS and radio. These vessels will have thousands of miles of range, and use solar to provide power to all electronics, meaning they can stay at sea for months.</p>

<p>By deploying thousands of these vessels, we will drastically reduce the risk of iceberg collisions, saving lives and money.</p>

<p>Here are some images of a prototype <i>Iceberg Tracker</i> robotic vessel:</p>
