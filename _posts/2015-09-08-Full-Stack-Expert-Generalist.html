<p>Does your passion align with what the world wants? I believe I am fortunate to have a passion in all things tech, since that knowledge has a premium to it. This was reinforced after reading about the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-full-stack-developer-is-a-myth-4e3fb9c25867" target="_blank">myth of the full stack developer</a> on Medium. I say this because everything I have been doing over the past few months is included in what is expected of a full stack developer, meaning that I am highly valued (I've always told myself that, but now it is for real. Haha!).</p>

<p>So why is are full stack developers so mythical? As Scott Hadfield, the CTO of Hello Pretty, a designer marketplace, described, very few people have the massive area of expertise required (and those that do are happily employed). What are some of these skills that are needed? Take a look at the table below. A true full stack developer would be an expert in at least two of components for each layer (plus other unlisted layers).</p>

<p>As you can see, a full stack developer has to be an <a href="https://medium.com/life-learning/the-one-trait-that-elon-musk-ben-franklin-and-marie-curie-have-in-common-33114edfe279" target="_blank">expert generalist</a>. In a sense, they are the glue that is holding the rest of the team and project together. I find it cool that by being a one-man-band right now, I am becoming a full stack developer out of necessity. I will say that being curious has been beneficial once again.</p>
