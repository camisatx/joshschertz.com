<p>I have just completed my first week of the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-nanodegree--nd209" target="_blank">Udacity Robotics Nanodegree</a>, and it was an enjoyable challenge. I have never had the opportunity to use and program so many mathematical concept into a single project before. I love how robotics combines the skills from so many areas into a single field.</p>

<p>This week's project was built around the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html" target="_blank">NASA sample return challenge</a>, where the goal was to navigate and find all yellow rock samples within the environment, returning back to the starting position once all samples were collected. I had to build the perception and decision logic for a simulated rover.</p>

<p>Go checkout the code and write up I built in this <a href="https://github.com/camisatx/RoboND-Rover-Project" target="_blank">repository</a>. Feel free to download the simulator, code and dependencies, and try your hand at improving the system!<p>

<p>As I wrote at the bottom of the README, there are many areas that can be improved on. I know that I'll be able to implement most of these improvements once I have more experience with robotics. Improving my computer vision skills will be extremely useful, as this project relies exclusively on a camera feed. Also, I know that learning about path finding algorithms will be helpful for providing smoother environment navigation.<p>

<p>I will try to revisit this project as I learn more skills. It'll be a good test bed for experimenting with new ideas.<p>
