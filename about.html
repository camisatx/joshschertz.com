<p>Hey, I'm Josh!<p>

<p>I'm an autodidactic programmer, web developer and computer guru. I am passionate about technology and the universe around us.</p>

<p>I am currently building <a href="https://helpme.vote" target="_blank">Help Me Vote</a>, a site that will revolutionize how people prepare for elections. In order to make good ballot choices, we need to see the complete picture. Healthy democracies require complete transparency in the actions of the politicians.</p>

<p>Previously, I cofounded an algorithmic trading firm that focused on stock and option arbitrage strategies. We built a custom trading system in Python that allowed us to quickly iterate through strategies. You can view the database system we used <a href="https://github.com/camisatx/pysecmaster">here</a>.</p>

<p>My background is in finance and accounting, but I don't let that determine what I can and can not do. A degree is no substitute for grit and self motivation. I make my own future.</p>
