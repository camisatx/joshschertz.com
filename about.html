<p>Hey, I'm Josh!<p>

<p>I'm an autodidactic programmer, roboticist, web developer and computer guru. I am passionate about technology and the universe around us.</p>

<p>Currently, I am experimenting with building and controlling <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/robotics">robotic manipulators</a>, focusing on the integration of pneumatic grippers. I'm also eagerly researching the use of advanced inverse kinematic methods for arm control.</p>

<p>I am enrolled in the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/robotics" target="_blank">Udacity Robotics Nanodegree</a>, a 6 month project based course focused on the major areas of robotics. You can view all of my course notes and projects <a href="https://github.com/camisatx/RoboticsND" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I cofounded Sayv, an algorithmic trading firm that focused on stock and option arbitrage strategies. We built a custom trading system in Python that allowed us to quickly iterate through strategies. You can view the database system we used <a href="https://github.com/camisatx/pysecmaster">here</a>.</p>

<p>My background is in finance and accounting, but I don't let that determine what I can and can not do. A degree is no substitute for grit and self motivation. I make my own future.</p>
