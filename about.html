<p>Hey, I'm Josh!<p>

<p>I'm an autodidactic programmer, roboticist, web developer and computer guru. I am passionate about technology and the universe around us.</p>

<p>Currently I'm the technical cofounder of <a href="https://www.grokspace.net" target="_blank">grokSpace</a>, a space analytics firm, and am a Masters student at the Colorado School of Mines <a href="https://space.mines.edu/" target="_blank">Space Resources program</a>, focusing on the commercialization of space. My research has covered <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/papers/Modern-Review-of-ANTS.pdf" target="_blank">spacecraft swarms</a>, and the business potential of an application to provide consolidated data on asteroids.</p>

<p>Previously, I cofounded Sayv, an algorithmic trading firm that focused on stock and option arbitrage strategies. We built a custom trading system in Python that allowed us to quickly iterate through strategies. You can view the database system we used <a href="https://github.com/camisatx/pysecmaster">here</a>.</p>

<p>My background is in finance and accounting, but I don't let that determine what I can and can not do. A degree is no substitute for grit and self motivation. I make my own future.</p>
